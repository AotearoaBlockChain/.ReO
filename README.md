# ReO Interpreter

The ReO interpreter is a Rust-based tool for executing programs written in the ReO programming language, designed to integrate cultural integrity and blockchain operations.

## Features

- Supports variables, control structures (`mēnā`, `i te wā`, etc.), functions, and blockchain operations (`whitinga`, `pōka`, etc.).
- Implements cryptography functions (`kōko`, `whakamuka`, etc.) and peer-to-peer communication (`hono`).
- Includes a standard library for common operations and API integrations (`te raraunga`).

## Installation

To use the ReO interpreter, clone the repository and compile using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reo-interpreter.git
cd reo-interpreter
cargo build
