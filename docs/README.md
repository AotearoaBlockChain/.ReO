# .ReO Programming Language

.ReO is a programming language designed to develop the Aotearoa Blockchain Ecosystem, tailored to the needs and requirements of Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the diverse nature of tikanga (customs) throughout different hapū (sub-tribes). 

## Purpose

The primary purpose of .ReO is to create a blockchain ecosystem that respects and integrates the unique cultural and legal context of Aotearoa, including:

- Development of decentralized applications.
- Execution of smart contracts.
- Integration with various APIs and programming languages.
- Upholding the principles and values of Te Ao Māori (the Māori worldview).

## Key Features

- **Variables and Data Types**: Support for basic data types like numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays.
- **Control Structures**: Implementation of if-else statements, loops, and function declarations.
- **Blockchain Operations**: Functions to create and manage transactions, blocks, contracts, and more.
- **Cryptography**: Support for encryption, decryption, and hashing.
- **P2P Communication**: Functions to connect peers in the blockchain network.
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployment and invocation of smart contracts.
- **Interoperability**: Integration with other programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++.

## Legal Considerations

The legal framework for .ReO is grounded in the Treaty of Waitangi 1840 and He Whakaputanga (the Declaration of Independence) 1835, recognizing the sovereign capacity of the confederated tribes and the collective hapū of Aotearoa.

- **Treaty of Waitangi 1840**: Article 2 (English version) and the entire reo (Māori) version emphasize the protection of taonga tuku iho (treasured possessions).
- **He Whakaputanga 1835**: Affirms the independence and sovereignty of the Māori tribes.
